					    <p>I started honing in on my skills as a barber at the age of 10 when I was given a pair of clippers by my mom. Soon after that I was noticed by those around me; I started to not only cut my own hair but friends, family, neighbors and classmates. I studied barbering at Cutting Edge Hair Styling Academy in Kansas City, Kansas. Professionally, I worked at Debonair's Barber Shop in Topeka, Kansas with three other master barbers who had over 20 years experience. I moved to LA to pursue acting  and was a barber for my day job, Skills were noticed by Master Barber Christopher Hird and I soon became on board as the lead barber at Christopher Styles Barber Shop.</p>

					    <p>Hi my name is Laura Flores! At a young age I knew I wanted to become a cosmetologist. After getting my high school diploma, I enrolled myself at Marinello schools of beauty. Soon after graduating I became a licensed cosmetologist. After filling a few applications online and not getting any response I went to visit my teachers back at Marinello. I came across a lady who let me know about Christopher styles. Before I knew it, I was working with an amazing professional staff. Come see me, I currently do manicures and pedicures for both men and women!</p>

					    <p>Christopher Styles Barber Spa is a dream come true. The concept originated when I opened my first shop at the age of 23. I knew then that I wanted a nice modern shop for men to come relax and feel comfortable while enjoying getting groomed. I enjoyed a manicure from time to time, but didn't feel comfortable going to a nail spa. I thought that there should be a place where men could go, get their nails manicured, and most importantly feel comfortable. In 2005 I developed a plan of action which when implemented would provide such a place.</p>
						<p>I knew that the time wasn't right to take on such a major ordeal, so I placed the plans in an envelope. In October of 2011 I opened the envelope and felt that the time was perfect to implement this plan. After several months of working on a business plan I presented the plan to my business partner and the hunt for the perfect location began. A future stylist found the location at 4815 Whitsett Avenue in a small shopping center. My dream became reality when we signed the lease on August 1, 2012. And the rest is history. During this journey God opened several doors and God closed several doors. I thank him for the wisdom and guidance that he has granted me during this entire process.</p>
