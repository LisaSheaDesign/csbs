					    <h3 class="media-heading">Brent Jones - Master Barber</h3>
					    <p>When Brent was 10 years old, his mother handed him a pair of clippers. What he did with them garnered the attention of those around him. With his quickly developing cutting skills, Brent decided to enroll at Cutting Edge Hair Styling Academy in Kansas City. When he eventually moved to Los Angeles, his barbering skills caught the eye of Christopher Hird. He soon after joined Christopher Styles Barber Shop.</p>
							<p>Today, Brent is the shop's modern day Renaissance man. He continually exercises his artistic abilities through painting, music, acting, and barbering. When Brent is in the shop, there is always a lively discussion happening at his station. His clients keep him busy and in high demand. He is known for his amazing fades, shaves, and uncanny ability for styling. While you'll likely find Brent laughing and singing around the shop, his hair designs and highly detailed face shaves reveal a talent for focused precision and not to mention a serious work ethic. Brent is constantly rising to new creative challenges and hopes to continue exceeding expectations by giving clients a look they didn't imagine was possible for them.</p>

					    <h3 class="media-heading">Sofia Gomez - Stylist</h3>
					    <p>SSofia started her path to become a stylist at a Cut in Time in Woodland Hills in 2007 while also attending cosmetology school. For seven years, she juggled being the shop's full time receptionist, assistant, and manager during the day while fitting in her own clients after closing hours.</p>
							<p>Sofia's incessant motivation to pursue the art of hairstyling originates from her desire to make people feel good about themselves. When people look good, they feel good! She loves watching her clients fall in love with themselves again. She believes that liking the way you look is not about vanity but about loving one's self and being comfortable within our own mind and body.</p>
							<p>While most of the time you'll find Sofia doing a variety of fades, simple businessmen cuts, and gentlemen's undercut styles, her specialties also include women's cuts and color! She dreams of one day becoming a traveling hair colorist and haircutting educational trainer to help the next generation of students and current stylists learn more. However, at the end of the day, she enjoys the intimacy of working behind a chair, one on one with her clients.</p>
							<p>When Sofia isn't at the shop, she is working towards earning a bachelor's degree. She also attends hair training certification courses to further her skills and career. In her spare time, she enjoys working out and hanging out with friends and family.</p>
							<p>Random fact about Sofia: She was born in Argentina.</p>
							<p>Sofia's Hair Tip: Don't fight your hair. If it's naturally curly, rock your curls! If you have a dominant cowlick, part your hair that way! We fight many obstacles in our days, our hair shouldn't be one of them.</p>

She loves being able to help her clients feel more confident by transforming their look. Clients frequently request haircuts from the Brad Pitt or David Beckham gallery, but many of her clients eventually choose to trust Laura to provide the haircut that best suits their face shape, hair type, and lifestyle.</p>

					    <h3 class="media-heading">Christopher Styles - Owner/Barber</h3>
					    <p>Chris started on to something amazing when he was just 14 years old. He enjoyed looking great but didn't have money to go to a barber every week so his mother bought him his first set of clippers. He started cutting his own hair and then his friends' hair. By the time he was 16 he was charging $4 per haircut. Chris's professional barbering career began in 1997 in Pine Bluff, Arkansas when he received his Barber Stylist license. Eventually, Chris relocated to California and after years of perfecting his techniques he decided to integrate his natural business acumen and barbering skills and open Christopher Styles Barber Spa in October of 2012.</p>
							<p>Today, Chris specializes in all men's haircuts and shaves with many of his clients coming in for afros, fades, and straight razor shaves. He loves the fact that he can transform a person right before their eyes within as little as 30 minutes. It's an instant makeover with instant gratification! While clients come to him for his reputation, they return not just because of his proven skills but also because of his relatability and honesty.</p>
							<p>Chris's ambition always keeps him looking ahead. He aspires to one day open another shop and possibly start a product line. He also hopes to mentor young stylist to become salon owners, platform artists, and overall great stylists within the industry.</p>
							<p>Random fact about Chris: He has a snack every night right before going to sleep.</p>
							<p>Hair tip: Don't over shampoo your hair. Shampooing everyday is not necessary as it tends to dry your scalp and hair. Whenever you wash, use a conditioner to replenish your scalp and hair after shampooing it.</p>
