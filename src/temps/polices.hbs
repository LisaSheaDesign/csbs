				<h1>Polices</h1>
				<h2>New polices effective June 1st 2019</h2>
				<h3>Late policy</h3>
				<p>We ask that you arrive on time to your appointment. We understand that traffic can cause unexpected delays, but due to our shop booking every 30 minute appointments, we can no longer take clients more than 10 minutes late.  Unless stylist/barber states he or she can fit you in without effecting next client, you will be asked to reschedule. All of our clients are important to us and we do everything in our power to accommodate schedules, however we would not want to give anyone unsatisfactory service, due to time constraints.</p>
				<h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
				<p>24 hours in advance notice would be greatly appreciated. Due to the fact that we are busy and in our time slots are limited, we ask that you give us a call at least 24 hours in advance in order to cancel a scheduled appointment.  We do our best to respect our clients time and expect our clients to respect our time as well.</p>
				<h3>No call/No show</h3>
				<p>2nd no show-warning After 3rd no show-prepayment will be required prior to booking or walk-in basis only.</p>
				<p>We thank each of you for your continued support and we look forward to continuing to give great haircuts and exceptional customer service you have become custom too.</p>
				<p>C-STYLES TEAM</p>

				<p>Call the shop to ask about other services we offer such as color/highlights, blowdrys, and hair designs that are not available through Online Booking.</p>
