					    <h3 class="media-heading">Christopher Styles - Owner/Barber</h3>
					    <p>Chris started on to something amazing when he was just 14 years old. He enjoyed looking great but didn't have money to go to a barber every week so his mother bought him his first set of clippers. He started cutting his own hair and then his friends' hair. By the time he was 16 he was charging $4 per haircut. Chris's professional barbering career began in 1997 in Pine Bluff, Arkansas when he received his Barber Stylist license. Eventually, Chris relocated to California and after years of perfecting his techniques he decided to integrate his natural business acumen and barbering skills and open Christopher Styles Barber Spa in October of 2012.</p>
							<p>Today, Chris specializes in all men's haircuts and shaves with many of his clients coming in for afros, fades, and straight razor shaves. He loves the fact that he can transform a person right before their eyes within as little as 30 minutes. It's an instant makeover with instant gratification! While clients come to him for his reputation, they return not just because of his proven skills but also because of his relatability and honesty.</p>
							<p>Chris's ambition always keeps him looking ahead. He aspires to one day open another shop and possibly start a product line. He also hopes to mentor young stylist to become salon owners, platform artists, and overall great stylists within the industry.</p>
							<p>Random fact about Chris: He has a snack every night right before going to sleep.</p>
							<p>Hair tip: Don't over shampoo your hair. Shampooing everyday is not necessary as it tends to dry your scalp and hair. Whenever you wash, use a conditioner to replenish your scalp and hair after shampooing it.</p>
