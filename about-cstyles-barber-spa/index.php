							<p>Monday, October 8th, 2012 in Valley Village, CA Christopher Styles Barber Spa was proud to announce their first day in business as a Modern Barber Shop. In two months of its opening, this hard working diverse staff has received a five star yelp rating. Receiving high recommendations from dedicated, long-term, and new clients this barbershop has served the community in cutting and styling over 700 clients and it continues to grow today.</p>
							<p>Once you walk into Christopher Styles you become a part of the family. From the start you are welcomed with smiling faces. Sink in to our comfy sofa or chairs, put your feet up, have some coffee and use the iPad&rsquo;s to take care of business while you wait. On Saturdays get a taste of our drink special. Ask our friendly receptionists about online booking! It is another great option to make your appointment, but we still enjoy speaking to you over the phone. We book in advance and do our best to get you in at your convenience and walk-ins are also welcome. Once you are in the chair, sit back, relax and enjoy one of your favorite shows on many flat screens throughout the shop. Sometimes you may even catch us dancing to our favorite music playing at a comfortable volume in the background, hand-picked by our staff. We maintain a strong bond between staff members and clientele inside and outside the shop. We use this strength to reach out to our local community. Through volunteering and supporting non-profit organizations we are always ready to help. Make sure to check out our events on our home page! Everyone is always welcome at our in shop and out shop activities.</p> 
							<p>&ldquo;Detailed to Perfection&rdquo; is the motto that best describes this barbershop. From the moment clients walk in they feel exclusive. Here, one can revive and replenish energy lost from life&rsquo;s daily demands. With skilled and experienced stylists and barbers every man and woman will walk away with a cut designed to enhance their confidence. In addition to high quality cuts, services such as classic straight razor face shaves also provide the ultimate clean look. After your hair cut, don&rsquo;t leave yet! You can&rsquo;t forget about our hot towels! Mmm oh yeah... warmed to perfection and waiting for you in a hot towel warmer. In the summertime, cool, icy-crisp towels are provided. Mani&rsquo;s, pedi&rsquo;s, eyebrow waxing, and color are just a few additional services that cater to both men and women. We also provide package deals that get you more than one service for a great deal!</p>
							<p>Quality, consistency and continuous customer care is a priority for Christopher Styles Barber Spa. This is reflected through the professional staff as they take their time perfecting their talent to make each client feel one of a kind.</p>
