<h3 style="color: black;">Christopher Styles Barber Spa - TEMPORARY CLOSING</h3>
<p>Over the past few weeks, we have been working tirelessly to combat the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. We have monitored and mirrored local, state, and federal health guidelines by taking temperatures, providing screens for clients and mask.</p>
<p>We want to let you know that due to the continuing uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and the escalation of state declaration of Governor Newsom, we are temporarily closing our salon effective Tuesday, July 14, 2020, until further notice.</p>
<p>When we do see you again, we understand that you will likely need a haircut, styling, or a color refresh. We would be honored to welcome you back so you can enjoy a moment for yourself with one of our amazing stylists.</p>
<p>Watch for updates from us via our website.  A heartfelt thank you for your ongoing support and understanding during these remarkable times; it means a tremendous amount to our  stylist.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you soon.
